            Cambridge TCG is built on a simple belief: trading cards carry meaning beyond their market value. They are art. They are nostalgia. They are the stories we tell each other.

          <div className="space-y-4 text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              We started as collectors who wanted something better. Not just another shop — a place where the card community could thrive. Where you could show others your treasures, find the cards you have been searching for, and connect with people who understand why a piece of illustrated cardboard can mean so much.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trading cards sit at the intersection of art, nostalgia, community, and finance. A card is a memory of the pack you opened as a child. It is a piece of Japanese art that stopped you mid-scroll. It is a conversation starter at a local tournament. It is an asset in a portfolio you built card by card.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built Cambridge TCG to honour all of those dimensions at once.

                Every card is a piece of art. The Japanese illustrators who create these cards pour their craft into every line. We source directly from Japan because we believe you deserve the original, authentic expression of that art. When you hold a Japanese One Piece card, you are holding something made with intention and care.

                Cards are social objects. They are meant to be shown, discussed, traded, and admired. Our platform is designed around this truth. Build your public collection. Showcase your prized pulls. Follow other collectors. Find people who want what you have and have what you want. Every feature we build asks the same question: does this bring collectors closer together?

                Collecting is a journey, not a transaction. Track your portfolio, watch its value grow, complete sets, earn achievements. We built tools that make the journey visible and rewarding — not just the moment of purchase, but everything that comes after.

                We believe collectors should be able to trade directly with each other. But P2P trading needs trust. That is why we built our marketplace as a hybrid: peer-to-peer philosophy with centralised protection. We verify identities, inspect cards, hold escrow, resolve disputes, and build trust scores over time. You get the freedom of direct trading with the safety of a platform that has your back.

                Cards have real value. We do not pretend otherwise. Our market shows real-time prices, bid/ask spreads, and trade history — like a proper exchange. Your portfolio tracks P&L. Our trade-in credit creates a liquidity floor on every card. But the financial layer serves the community, not the other way around. The goal is not speculation — it is giving collectors the information and tools to make good decisions about the cards they love.
